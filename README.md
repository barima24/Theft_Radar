Automobile Theft Tracking Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of stolen vehicles from the New Zealand Police Department's Vehicle of Interest Database, covering 4K+ of theft data. Each record represents a single stolen vehicle, containing details such as vehicle type, make, year, color, date stolen, and region stolen.

# Key Objectives:
- **Day of the Week**: Identifying the days when vehicles are most and least often stolen.
- **Vehicle Type Trends**: Examining which types of vehicles are most and least frequently stolen, and whether these trends differ by region.
- **Average Age of Stolen Vehicles**: Calculating the average age of stolen vehicles and exploring how this varies based on vehicle type.
- **Regional Patterns**: Analyzing which regions experience the highest and lowest number of stolen vehicles, and examining the characteristics of these regions.

# Tools and Techniques:
- **SQL for ETL**: Data was extracted, cleaned, and transformed using SQL to ensure it was ready for analysis.
- **Tableau for Visualization**: A dynamic dashboard was created to visualize trends and patterns, enabling easy exploration of insights.
  
This project provides valuable insights into vehicle theft patterns, helping law enforcement and policymakers allocate resources effectively and develop strategies to reduce crime.
